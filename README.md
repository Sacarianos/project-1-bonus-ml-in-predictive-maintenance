# Bonus Project I | Business Case for Machine Learning in Predictive Maintenance

## Executive Summary

Predictive maintenance is revolutionizing the way industries manage equipment maintenance. By predicting failures before they occur, companies can save costs, reduce downtime, and increase operational efficiency. This business case outlines the implementation of a machine learning model to predict equipment failures, leveraging historical sensor data.

## Data Collection

We will use one of the following datasets for our predictive maintenance model:

- AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle: [AI4I 2020 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020)
- NASA's Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset: NASA C-MAPSS Dataset found [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/nasa-turbofan-jet-engine-data-set).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

### Data Overview

You will begin by examining the datasets to understand the features and target variables.

### Visualization

Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to identify patterns and outliers in the data.

### Feature Engineering and Selection

#### Feature Engineering

You will create new features that may help improve the model's predictive power, such as rolling averages of sensor readings.

#### Feature Selection

Using techniques like feature importance and recursive feature elimination, we will select the most relevant features for our model.

### Model Building

#### Model Selection

You will experiment with various algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, to find the best performer.

#### Model Training

You will train our models using the selected features and compare their performance.

### Model Evaluation Criteria and Metrics

#### Evaluation Metrics

You will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate our models.

#### Cross-Validation

Cross-validation will be employed to ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data.

### Model Fine-Tuning

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

You will use grid search and random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for our models.

### Model Deployment in Flask

#### Flask API

You will create a Flask application to serve our model's predictions over an API.

#### Endpoint Creation

The Flask app will have an endpoint that accepts sensor data and returns a failure prediction.

### Deliverables

- A PDF report documenting the approach, results, and analysis.
- Reproducible source code (jupyter notebook or .py files)
- PPT presentation
- Deploy your model in web app using the framework of your choice. 
- Bonus: host your app somewhere so it can be queried by anyone?


### Conclusion

The successful deployment of this predictive maintenance model could lead to significant cost savings and efficiency improvements. Future work may include integrating the model with real-time data streams for live predictions.
